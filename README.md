# Email Verifier .NET

This windows forms application allows you to verify the existance of an e-mail address mailbox.

It also allows you to connect to a SQL database, select a table, and define the column containing the email address value, it will then check the existance of each email address inside the table, and stores the value in a temp column inside the application.
You can then export/copy the results to an excel sheet, or any other software of your choice.

PLEASE NOTE: The application will not ammend your database and/or SQL table in any way.
